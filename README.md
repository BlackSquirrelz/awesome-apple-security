# macOS-Forensics
Collection of macOS (Forensics) Resources to get you started with macOS Forensics.

This list is just a collection of stuff I found during research, it is not a definitive guide, also I am not sponsored or have any other interests except for the content of these resources. Some of the information you find in the books, or blogs may be outdated but should give you a good understanding nevertheless.
